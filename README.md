# The Principles of Solarpunk

Solarpunk is a growing movement focused on creating a sustainable environment, social justice, and freedom and equality for all. To read, please go to ./exports/principles.pdf

## How to Commit

Please open an issue/pull request for your changes or additions. We should all work together to create something that represents our movement, not just one persons idea of it. This is a growing, community driven effort. With that in mind, the principles.txt file contains the markdown, and the exports folder (Not currently in the repo) contains exports to .pdf and .odt

## Software 

This project will be built on exclusively open source software. Principles.txt will be written in markdown, and converted to PDF and ODT with Pandoc. Text writers used should be open source, though this is un-enforceable.
