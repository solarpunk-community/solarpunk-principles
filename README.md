# The Principles of Solarpunk

Solarpunk is a growing movement focused on creating a sustainable environment, social justice, and freedom and equality for all.

## How to Commit

Please open an issue/pull request for your changes or additions. @StarrKiss is taking the liberty of writing the first draft, but if that work is not liked, we can replace it. Other people may also add their thoughts. This is a growing, community driven effort. With that in mind, the principles.txt file contains the markdown, and the exports folder (Not currently in the repo) contains exports to .pdf and .odt
